# Roman Numerals Kata

The object of this kata is to practice TDD with different frameworks.
We do this by creating a function that converts from decimal numbers to
roman numerals. The basic test cases are written in the respective
directories.

## Legend: Make sure this works

    0    = nothing
    1    = I
    2    = II
    3    = III
    4    = IV
    5    = V
    6    = VI
    7    = VII
    8    = VIII
    9    = IX
    10   = X
    20   = XX
    40   = XL
    49   = XLIX
    50   = L
    99   = XCIX
    100  = C
    500  = D
    1000 = M
    3994 = MMMCMXCIV
